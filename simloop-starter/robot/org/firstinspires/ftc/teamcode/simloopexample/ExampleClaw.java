/**
 * A two-position claw on one servo, written the way an ordinary FTC subsystem is written.
 *
 * <p>It is here because a servo is the mechanism most teams reach for first and the one most likely to
 * be left out of a simulation, on the grounds that a servo just goes where it is told. It does not: it
 * takes time to get there.
 *
 * <p><b>A bare servo has no sensor</b>, so this class genuinely cannot tell you where the jaws are - and
 * neither can a real one. {@link #getCommandedPosition()} is the command, not a measurement, and there
 * is deliberately no {@code isSettled()} reading it back, because such a method would return true on the
 * tick the command was issued and would be a lie on hardware as well as in simulation.
 *
 * <p>What a routine does instead is wait {@link #TRAVEL_TIME_SECONDS} after commanding, and the honest
 * question is whether that number is big enough. That is exactly the question simulation can answer:
 * SimLoop models the travel in a {@code PositionalServoPlant}, so the example's test drives this
 * subsystem, waits the constant below, and then asserts against the modelled jaws. Shorten the constant
 * and the test fails - which on the field would have been a sample dropped on the way up.
 *
 * <p><b>The robot this belongs to is invented</b>, and so are the two servo positions.
