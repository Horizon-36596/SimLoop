/**
 * A short autonomous routine, and the two things about it that a simulation can catch and a bench test
 * cannot.
 *
 * <p>The routine drives forward, raises the slide to scoring height, waits, and opens the claw. Written
 * as a tiny state machine, because that is how an autonomous is written and because a routine written
 * as a straight line of blocking sleeps cannot be stepped one tick at a time.
 *
 * <p>The assertions at the bottom are the point:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The chassis ends up somewhere sensible.</b> Loose bounds on purpose - the useful failure here
 *       is a drivetrain that strafes when told to go straight or turns when told to go nowhere, and a
 *       tight bound on distance would only make the test fail whenever anyone touched a gear ratio.</li>
 *   <li><b>The claw's wait is long enough.</b> {@link ExampleClaw#TRAVEL_TIME_SECONDS} is a guess a team
 *       makes once. This test reads that constant rather than repeating it, so shortening it there fails
 *       here - which on the field would have been a sample released before the jaws were open.</li>
 * </ul>
