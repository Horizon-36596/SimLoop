/**
 * The simulated {@link ExampleRobot}: fake devices under the names the robot's own subsystems look up,
 * a plant behind each one, and the physical numbers that describe the machine.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the file your team writes once and then stops thinking about.</b> The subsystems in
 * {@code simloop-starter/robot/} know nothing about any of this; every test in the project builds one of
 * these and drives the robot through it, so a new mechanism is added here once rather than in each test.
 *
 * <h2>The order a tick happens in</h2>
 *
 * <p>Getting this wrong is the one mistake that produces a plausible-looking wrong answer rather than an
 * error, so it is written out. Each tick:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Robot code runs</b> - {@code robot.periodic()}, or whatever the scenario is testing. It reads
 *       sensors and writes motor powers, exactly as it would in an OpMode loop.</li>
 *   <li><b>The plants advance</b>, reading the powers that robot code just wrote.</li>
 *   <li><b>The sensors are told what the plants did</b> - {@link #advancePhysics(double)} pushes the
 *       slide plant's position into the slide encoder. This is the step that makes the next tick's robot
 *       code see the truth instead of its own command.</li>
 *   <li><b>The devices tick</b> - {@code hardwareMap.updateAll}, which is where each fake derives what it
 *       derives from elapsed time, such as the encoder's velocity.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>A test therefore calls {@code robot.periodic()} and then {@link #advancePhysics(double)}, in that
 * order, once per tick.
 *
 * <h2>Where these numbers come from</h2>
 *
 * <p>They are invented - plausible round figures for the invented robot, not measurements of anything.
 * On your own robot every one of them is measured or characterised, and the value of doing that is that
 * a simulation built on measured numbers can be wrong in a way you can see.
